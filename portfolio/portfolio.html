                Your UI should include four main elements:
                
                Input field for the user to type in their temperature - don't forget to validate that the input is a number!
                Dropdown menu or radio button for the user to choose if they are inputting in Celsius or Fahrenheit
                "Convert" button to trigger the temperature conversion
                Display area for the final converted temperature and unit
                </p>
